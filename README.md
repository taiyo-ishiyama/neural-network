## Neural Network Project
The neural network consists of three layers (input layer, hidden layer, output layer)

This program is written using Mac OS


## Initiate the program
**The users have to include the appropriate parameters to execute the file.
*<number of neurons in input layer> <number of neurons in hidden layer> <number of neurons in output layer> <file path to training data> <file path to testing data>
* eg. (python nn.py 784 30 10 fashion-mnist_train.csv.gz fashion-mnist_test.csv.gz)



## The use of the program
** 4 different testcases are involved in the source code. However, the users are allowed to change the learning environment by adjusting the value for epoch, mini-batch size, and learning rate.

** As the data set is too big to upload on GitHub, please prepare "fasion mnist" data set on your own.
